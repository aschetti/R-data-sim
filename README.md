# Simulate data in R with the `faux` package

## Introduction

Materials of the hands-on workshop **Simulate data in *R* with the [`faux`](https://github.com/debruine/faux/) package**.

## How to use these materials

* Download this GitHub repository by clicking on the green button ***Clone or download***
* Unzip the folder somewhere on your hard disk
* Double-click on ***data_sim.Rproj*** to open the self-contained RStudio project
* From the *Files* panel in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), click on `data_sim.Rmd` (in the `code` subfolder) to access the code
* In the same subfolder you will also find the complete output (`data_sim.html`), in case you just want to follow along rather than changing the code
